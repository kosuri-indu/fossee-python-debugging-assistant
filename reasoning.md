# Reasoning  

1) What tone and style should the AI use when responding?
The AI should guide the student in a friendly way. It should be clear and encouraging, so the student feels confident to try fixing the bugs.

2) How should the AI balance identifying bugs and guiding the student?
The AI should show where the problem might be and explain why. It should give hints and suggest small tests to check the code. The student should figure out the final fix themselves.  

3) How would you adapt this prompt for beginner vs. advanced learners?
For beginners, the AI gives longer explanations and simple examples. For advanced learners, it is more concise and technical. This makes the same prompt work for all students.  

Prompt engineering techniques used:  
- Role: the AI is assigned as a mentor, not a solution provider.  
- Constraints: the AI is told not to give the full code.  
- Guidelines: step-by-step instructions and questions guide the AIâ€™s response.  
- Skill adaptation: instructions differ for beginners and advanced learners.  
- Example style: shows how hints should be phrased.  
- Focus on reasoning: the AI explains why a bug exists, not how to fix it directly.
