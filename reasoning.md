# Reasoning  

1) What tone and style should the AI use when responding?  
The AI should use a friendly, patient and supportive tone. It should sound like a mentor who is guiding the student, not a strict examiner. The style should be clear and non-judgmental so that students feel encouraged to keep trying.  

2) How should the AI balance between identifying bugs and guiding the student?  
The AI should identify possible buggy areas, but not immediately provide the fix. It should give hints, ask reflective questions and suggest debugging strategies such as printing variables or re-checking conditions. The balance comes from showing where the issue might lie and why, while letting the student figure out the correction.  

3) How would you adapt this prompt for beginner vs. advanced learners?  
For beginners, the AI should use simple words, step-by-step hints and explain concepts in detail, even with examples if needed. For advanced learners, the AI can be more concise and technical, assuming familiarity with programming concepts. This way the same prompt can work for both groups, but the depth of explanation changes depending on the learner.
