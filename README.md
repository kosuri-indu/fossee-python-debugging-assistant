# FOSSEE Python AI Debugging Assistant Prompt  

This repository contains my submission for Python Screening Task 2 of the FOSSEE Semester-Long Internship (Autumn 2025).  

## Task Objective  
Design a natural-language prompt that instructs an AI assistant to:  
- Analyze buggy Python code provided by students  
- Provide hints and guidance without revealing the full solution  
- Encourage learning by focusing on debugging thought process  

## Repository Structure  
- `prompt.md` → The designed AI prompt  
- `reasoning.md` → Detailed explanation of design choices, tone, and adaptation  
- `tested_examples.md` → Sample buggy code + how the AI would respond  
- `README.md` → Overview of submission  
- `LICENSE` → MIT License  

## Uniqueness of My Approach  
- Designed with educational psychology principles → promotes curiosity, not spoon-feeding.  
- Includes different response styles for beginners vs. advanced learners.  
- Tested on sample buggy codes in `tested_examples.md`.  

## Submission Info  
This project is submitted as part of the FOSSEE Semester Long Internship (Autumn 2025) under Python Screening Task 2.
